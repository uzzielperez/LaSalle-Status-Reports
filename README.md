# LaSalle-Status-Reports

## October 25, 2024
* VELO+ECAL Workflow Fundamentals and older version of Gauss. See [Tutorial](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ciperez/spacal-simulation/-/tree/master/documentation/Tutorial_v3.0?ref_type=heads)
* Checked cuts implemented by Alexia and also scaling up the plotting - making it more automated for reproducing them when necessary

In-progress:
* Ganga job submission for spacal-simulation. I have mainly a question on files to include.
* Redo the ECAL simulation with Dtopipipi or maybe some other process? Understand what has been included and what elements need to be worked on.
* Foundation Models - Opportunities and Risks... 

## October 18, 2024
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/670fc88389caa7db2f24b)
* [Checked file paths and refactoring Alexia's code](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lasalle/rad-lb02lbgammabr-obs/lb02lbgammabr). Making the code more modular. 
* Got new instructions for the spacal-sim - Parker... Waiting on DecFiles from Liupan An's. 
* [Flavour Physics](https://github.com/uzzielperez/Flavour-Physics)
